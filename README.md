# Galactic Quadrant Analysis Program

## Introduction and Problem Statement

<p align="justify">
  Greetings, this project is an extension from one of my Algorithm Subject's assignment. The original assignment is mainly about implementing and applying graph related algorithms on solving various problems. In that case, I was given a few tasks to solve.
</p>

  - The tasks are:
    - to create an adjacency list and matrix
    - to display edges and planets sorted using merge sort algorithm
    - to implement dynamic programming via 0/1 knapsack algorithm
    - to apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path

  In the original assignment, I was given a scenario to assist the captain of a spaceship who collects items/products from a number of planets in a galactic quadrant. There are 3 maps, but I only had to do one map. My task is to do some analysis on the quadrant map. I had to create an association among the planets with respect to the quadrant map given by creating the adjacency list and matrix for visualization. In addition, I had to list out the sorted edges and planets using a sorting algorithm which I have chosen to apply the merge sort algorithm. Next, I had to find the shortest path from home planet to each planet by aplying the Dijkstra's algorithm. Finally, I have to identify the optimum set of planets to visit in order to collect their materials/minerals before returning home through dynamic programming via 0/1 knapsack algorithm. The original assignment is built using C++.
  
  So for this project, I have done a massive modification and refinement. I decided to convert the program from C++ to Java language and add GUI to the program by using Java Swing library where users can have a more friendly environment to use this program. The original assignment only need to do 1 map but I have done all the 3 maps and I also added one more map so it fulfills the meaning of galactic quadrant where each map represents a quadrant in the galaxy where I am residing in. 
  
  Furthermore, I also add a more coherent story to the program. Assuming a scenario where the users / us are in a civilization living on a planet located on the center of a galaxy known as Epsilon. In Epsilon, it is divided into 4 quadrants, which are Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta quadrants. In every quadrant, there are 10 planets, which are Planet A to Planet J. Every Planet A in every quadrant is also considered as a home planent. Planet A is also where our headquarters are located at. So our main task is to choose a quadrant to scout and explore the area, study and analysis the planets. To do this task with ease, we can use this program to learn the details and information of planet on every quadrant. The main function of this program is to give users the information on every planet and quadrant details like distance, route, mineral weight and profit before scouting the quadrants.
